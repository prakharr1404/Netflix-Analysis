NETFLIX ANALYSIS DASHBOARD using TABLEAU

Netflix Dashboard focuses on creating a dynamic Dashboard using Tableau to analyses and visualize the platform’s vast content library. Using a dataset containing 8,807 titles from 86 countries, we explored key metrics such as content type distribution, average duration, genre trends, content ratings, and director contributions. The analysis reveals that movies dominate Netflix’s offerings, accounting for 69.62% of the total content, while TV shows make up 30.38%. The most frequent content ratings are TV-MA and TV-14, indicating a strong presence of mature and teen-rated content.
The dashboard also tracks the yearly progression of content added from 2008 to 2021, highlighting significant growth in recent years. Additionally, top genres such as Stand-Up Comedy and Dramas are identified, along with prominent directors like Steven Spielberg and Rajiv Chilaka. By leveraging Tableau's interactive features, the dashboard enables users to filter and explore data based on different criteria such as genre, release year, and country. This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in extracting meaningful insights from entertainment data and supports better understanding of viewer trends and content strategy on platforms like Netflix
